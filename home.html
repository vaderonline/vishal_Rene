    <h3 id="headline"> Information About Mahatma Gandhi </h3> 
    <p> Mohandas Karamchand known as Mahatma or "Great-Souled" Gandhi was born in Porbandar, the capital of a small <br> principality in what is today the state of Gujarat in Western India, where his father was prime minister. His mother was <br>a profoundly religious Hindu. She and the rest of the Gandhi family belonged to a branch of Hinduism in which <br>non-violence and tolerance between religious groups were considered very important. His family background has later<br> been seen as a very important explanation of why Mohandas Gandhi was able to achieve the position he held in Indian society.</p>
